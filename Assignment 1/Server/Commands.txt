To build docker image :
docker build -t web-server .

To run docker container:
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e SERVER_ID=1 web-server

Note- 
1. The -t flag is used to tag the image with a name.
2. The -p flag is used to map the host port (5000) to the container port (5000). 
3. The -e flag is used to set environment variables inside the container. Here the SERVER_ID variable is set to 1.
